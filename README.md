# Group-Chat-App

This is a group chat application created using Spring Boot and WebSocket API.
You can just type in your name and start chatting with others. If no one is available
in the chat room, then you can open the app in two tabs, log in with different
usernames and start sending messages.
WebSocket is a communication protocol that makes it possible to establish a two-way communication channel between a server and a client.
